# pandas-db-manip

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas

In this project, I used Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library to manipulate data read from an excel file. The data pertained to the marketing performance of different products available on an e-commerce site, and my goal was to calculate the right price to charge for advertising on a given item. To do this, I referenced three separate excel files and created a dataframe of all the pertinent information and calculations to accurately provide the proposed bid. I then output this datafram into a seperate excel file.

This was an incredibly informative and worthwhile excercise in better understanding how to effectively use the Pandas Python library.
